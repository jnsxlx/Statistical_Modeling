# Statistical_Modeling
A R implementation of statistical modeling on a high school and beyond dataset.

## HSB dataset
The high school and beyond data set (hsb) is from a large-scale longitudinal study
conducted by the National Opinion Research Center (1980) under contract with the
National Center for Education Statistcs. The students in the study are a nationally
representative sample of n = 600 high school seniors with observations on 15 variables.

## Research question:
  From this set of data, we are interested to explore how different variables can be used to predict math performance. We will use all variables excluding `car`, as it is the result of a follow-up survey two years after the other data were collected, which makes very little empirical sense using it for prediction.
